# ATM System

## Project Overview
The ATM System is a simple Python-based application designed to simulate the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to perform transactions such as checking balances, withdrawing cash, and accessing a maintenance user interface through a web browser. This project provides a practical example of console-based programming in Python, along with a basic web interface.

## Installation
To get started with the ATM System, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
   ```
2. Change your directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd <PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME>
   ```

## Usage
To run the ATM System, follow these instructions:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory where `main.py` is located:
   ```bash
   cd src
   ```
2. Run the following command to start the ATM system:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
3. Once the system is running, access the maintenance UI by opening a web browser and entering the following URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Features
- User authentication to access ATM features.
- Basic transaction options including balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and deposit.
- A maintenance user interface accessible via a web browser.
- Simple error handling to manage user inputs.

## Dependencies
Please ensure you have the following package (if applicable) in your `package.json`. No specific package.json file was provided, but ensure you have Python as a prerequisite.

- Python 3.x
